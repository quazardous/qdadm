# Changelog

## 1.19.4

### Patch Changes

- Two docs/devDeps tweaks driven by feedback from a downstream consumer (qdcms) who hit a primevue dedupe trap when consuming qdadm via a `file:` link from a sibling monorepo:
  - **README — new section "Consuming via `file:` link from a sibling monorepo"** documents the `resolve.dedupe` pattern in the host's bundler config. Symptom = PrimeVue components render without Aura preset tokens (paginator buttons collapsed, datatable padding gone) because two copies of `primevue` end up in the bundle when the symlink is followed into the qdadm-monorepo's hoisted `node_modules`. Fix is one line in `vite.config.ts`: `resolve.dedupe: ['vue', 'vue-router', 'primevue', '@primeuix/themes']`. Doesn't affect npm consumers (the tarball ships no `node_modules/`) — purely a `file:`/`workspace:` link trap.
  - **`primevue` and `@primeuix/themes` added to `devDependencies`**, complementing the existing `peerDependencies` entries. The library itself doesn't ship primevue (it stays a peer), but local tests/builds of qdadm now resolve a deterministic version instead of relying on whatever the consumer workspace happens to have hoisted.

## 1.19.3

### Renamed — `qdadm` → `@quazardous/qdadm`

The package has been renamed from the unscoped `qdadm` to the scoped `@quazardous/qdadm`, joining `@quazardous/qdcore` and `@quazardous/qddebug` under a single scope. The unscoped `qdadm` on npm (versions up to 1.19.2) is being deprecated with a redirect notice. **Consumers must update**:

```diff
- "qdadm": "^1.19.2"
+ "@quazardous/qdadm": "^1.19.3"
```

```diff
- import { EntityManager } from "qdadm"
+ import { EntityManager } from "@quazardous/qdadm"
```

The codegen output also switches: generated `import { EntityManager } from "qdadm"` lines become `from "@quazardous/qdadm"`. Re-run `qdadmGen` after upgrade to refresh the generated files. The library API is unchanged — this is strictly a name/import-path migration.

The reasoning: keeping `qdadm` as an unscoped name created a permanent special case for tokens (npm Granular tokens scoped to `@quazardous` don't cover unscoped packages), Trusted Publishers (per-package config instead of scope-level), and CI tooling. Folding into the scope removes that whole class of friction.

### Patch Changes

- Three fixes reported by a downstream consumer running `vue-tsc --noEmit` against `qdadm@1.19.2`:
  - **Codegen now parameterizes the storage class with the entity type.** Generated managers were emitting `new ApiStorage(opts)` which defaults to `IStorage<EntityRecord>`; `EntityManager<XxxEntity>` expects `IStorage<XxxEntity>`, so every generated `*.ts` file failed type-check with TS2322. The codegen now emits `new ApiStorage<XxxEntity>(opts)` in both instance and class modes. Class mode also stops typing the constructor's `storage` override as `unknown` and uses `IStorage<XxxEntity>` instead.
  - **`vite-env.d.ts` declares `*.scss`, `*.css`, `*.sass` directly.** Previously these were only reachable through the `/// <reference types="vite/client" />` triple-slash, which silently failed for consumers whose `tsconfig.compilerOptions.types` didn't include `vite/client` or who didn't have `vite` installed. The internal `import('./styles.scss')` calls in `Module.ts`, `DebugModule.ts`, and `NotificationModule.ts` now type-check from any consumer context.
  - **`vite` declared as an optional peer dependency** with the wide range `^5.0.0 || ^6.0.0 || ^7.0.0 || ^8.0.0`, mirroring `@vitejs/plugin-vue@6.x`. Bumped the dev dep `@vitejs/plugin-vue` to `^6.0.0`. Consumers on Vite 7+ will see `qdadm/gen/vite-plugin` and `qdadm/vite-plugin-debug` resolve `Plugin` against their own Vite without the cross-version `Plugin<any>` mismatch that was hitting their `vue-tsc --noEmit`.
