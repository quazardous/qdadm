"@quazardous/qdadm": patch

Drop the Vite-specific `?raw` import for the built-in i18n defaults so qdadm works across bundlers and in `file:`/symlink consumer setups (qdadm #492).

`DefaultCoreProvider` previously did `import('./core.<locale>.yml?raw')`. The `?raw` query is a Vite-only binding: when qdadm is consumed via a `file:` link through a symlink (testbed, `npm link`, pnpm workspace), Vite serves the YAML over `@fs/<realpath>`, the real path resolves outside the consumer's workspace root, and `server.fs.allow` rejects it — breaking the admin at boot. It also fails outright under non-Vite bundlers (Webpack, esbuild, standalone Rollup) that don't understand `?raw`.

The `core.<locale>.yml` files remain the editable, translator-friendly source of truth. A generator (`scripts/gen-i18n-defaults.mjs`, `npm run gen:i18n-defaults`) emits committed `core.<locale>.generated.ts` modules that `export default` the raw YAML string; the provider now imports those plain TS modules. No build step at publish (the `.generated.ts` are committed, preserving the source-only model), per-locale code-splitting is unchanged, and a test fails if a `.yml` is edited without regenerating. Consumers on `file:`/symlink setups can drop the `server.fs.allow` workaround.
